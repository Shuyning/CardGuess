**Test guess card game**.

Controllers "CardFieldChooseController" and "GameCardSpawnController" need improvement (many dependencies).
The approach of building the game on canvas was chosen to speed up game development, it would have taken more time to adapt the game for tablets and phones with sprites. Also there are few moving UI elements in the game.
Finalise the architecture, Card components should inherently be View, not Components.
